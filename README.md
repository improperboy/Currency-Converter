# Currency Converter

A simple, responsive, and stylish currency converter web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Convert between multiple currencies
- Swap between "From" and "To" currencies easily
- Light and dark theme toggle
- Smooth animations and modern UI
- Uses pre-defined exchange rates (currently static but can be replaced with real API data)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom properties for theming, in a separate `styles.css` file)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS for interactivity, in a separate `script.js` file)

## How to Use

1. Enter the amount to convert.
2. Select the currency to convert from.
3. Select the currency to convert to.
4. Click the **Convert** button to get the converted amount.
5. Use the **Swap** button to switch currencies quickly.
6. Toggle between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** using the button in the top-right corner.

## Future Improvements

- Fetch live exchange rates from an API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API, Open Exchange Rates)
- Add historical data and conversion trends
- Support for more currencies
